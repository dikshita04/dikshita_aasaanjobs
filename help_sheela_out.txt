int i;
int j = 0;  

use XOR operator.

Lets say we have an array of size 5: 4, 3, 1, 2, 2

Which are at the index:   0, 1, 2, 3, 4

Now do an XOR of all the elements and all the indices.

 We get 2, which is the duplicate element.
 
This happens because, 0 plays no role in the XORing.

The remaining n-1 indices pair with same

n-1 elements in the array and the only unpaired element

in the array will be the duplicate.


for(i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    j = j^ arr[i] ^ i;
}
